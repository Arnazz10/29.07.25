### 🚀 What I Did Today

Today was a productive day filled with **language learning, backend exploration, and sharpening fundamentals**! Here's how it went:

---

### ✅ 1. **Revising DSA Fundamentals in Java**
- Revisited essential data structures like `Array`, `LinkedList`, `Stack`,`Queue` and  `Hashmap`.
- Brushed up on algorithm basics:
  - Searching and sorting techniques
  - Recursion and its flow in the call stack
  - HashMaps for frequency and lookup patterns
- Solved a few warm-up problems using Java.

- 📌 **Goal**: Strengthen core problem-solving muscle for consistent practice ahead.

---

### ✅ 2. **Java Full Stack Journey Begins 🌐**
- Started exploring **Spring Boot**, the backbone of modern Java backend dev.
- Created my first:
  - `@RestController` to handle simple GET requests
  - Connected basic endpoints to dummy frontend
  - Understood the role of **annotations** like `@Autowired`, `@Service`, `@Component`
- Installed Postman to test APIs easily.

- 📌 **Next Goal**: Dive deeper into JPA & database layer using MySQL.

---

### ✅ 3. **Dipping My Toes in Rust 🦀**
- Learned about Rust's:
  - Ownership & Borrowing concepts
  - `let`, `mut`, and type inference
- Wrote a small program printing Fibonacci numbers using `for` loop.
- 📌 **Feeling**: Rust is strict but powerful — memory safety is 🔥

---

### ✅ 4. **A Dash of Golang ☕🐹**
- Installed Go and explored its simple yet elegant syntax.
- Built a tiny HTTP server with:
  ```go
  http.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
      fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello from Golang!")
  })
